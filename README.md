# Hello, this is my portfolio!

Welcome to my self-hosted portfolio, available at [dash.passthebytes.com](https://dash.passthebytes.com).

Here, I aim to showcase everything I have built, experimented with, or learned. This repository contains my personal dashboard and other projects, all running on my own Linux server. I will be making as much of my self-hosted infrastructure public here on GitHub as I can.

I am passionate about self-hosting, open source, and building useful tools for myself and others. Over time, I will continue to add more of my work, experiments, and ideas here.

Feel free to explore, get inspired, or reach out if you have questions!
